ECLipsing bInary ProcesSing pipelinE

### What is this?

This is a pipeline to process light curves of eclipsing binary stars. It aims to be as general as possible but it is currently deployed on TESS data.

### What can it do?

Well, not much currently, but as soon as it does, we'll update this answer.

### I'd like to get involved!

Awesome! Find us on tessEBs.slack.com or tessEBs@googlegroups.com.
